(a)
- What can you say about the generalization properties of the logistic regression model?
- How does increasing the maximum number of iterations affect the model’s performance?

The logistic regression model generalizes well. The E_in and E_out are consistently very similiar indicating that the is enough data
for learning to occur, at least with this simple model. Increasing the maximum number of itereations, at least to up to 10^6,
continues to improve the model's performace. 

(b)
- Describe how you perform the normalization for the training set and testing set 
(i.e., what’s the mean and the variance that you use for normalization).

I normalized both the training and testing set to the mean and variance of the training set. This is because we never want to include
the testing data in training.

- Did normalizing the data affect the performance of the model?
Normalizing the data increases the performance of the model. Using the same paramaters without normalized data
yields E_in and E_out (binary) approaching random guessing.

- What is the effect of changing learning rate?
Changing the learning rate usally arrives at the same error but just at different rates.
The smallest learning rate takes > 20000 iterations to arrive at the same prediciton model as does 
a learning rate of 7 (which takes just 44). Too big of a learning rate becomes cumbersome very quickly however.
Increasing the learning rate to 7.6 makes us take 446 iterations and 7.7 makes us max out the number of iterations at 10^6!
